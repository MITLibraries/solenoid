# README

Instructions for setting the system up for local development are in `docs/README.md`. The `system_architecture.xml` file is designed to be read by draw.io.

There is a full maintenance plan on file with the PMO; `docs/maintenance.md` records developer-specific maintenance requirements in more detail.

## About the name

A solenoid is a coil of conductive metal. Changing the magnetic field around a solenoid, or moving the solenoid through a magnetic field, will induce an electric current to flow through it. The solenoid can thus help detect magnetic fields produced by nearby objects.

Similarly, `solenoid` detects certain research production at MIT and notifies observers.
