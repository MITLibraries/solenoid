## About the name

A solenoid is a coil of conductive metal. Changing the magnetic field around a solenoid, or moving the solenoid through a magnetic field, will induce an electric current to flow through it. The solenoid can thus help detect magnetic fields produced by nearby objects.

Similarly, `solenoid` detects certain research production at MIT and notifies observers.
